Targeted protein degradation is a promising therapeutic strategy to tackle disease-causing proteins that lack binding pockets for traditional small-molecule inhibitors. Its first step is to trigger the proximity between a ubiquitin ligase complex and a target protein through a heterobifunctional molecule, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), leading to the formation of a ternary complex. The properties of protein-protein interactions play an important regulatory role during this process, which can be reflected by binding cooperativity. Unfortunately, although computer-aided drug design has become a cornerstone of modern drug development, the endeavor to model targeted protein degradation is still in its infancy. The development of computational tools to understand the impacts of protein-protein interactions on targeted protein degradation, therefore, is highly demanded. To reach this goal, we constructed a non-redundant structural benchmark of the most updated ternary complexes and applied a kinetic Monte-Carlo method to simulate the association between ligases and PROTAC-targeted proteins in the benchmark.
